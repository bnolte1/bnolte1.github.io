Notes:
Changing the title and description
By default, the title of your site is username.github.io. You can change the title by editing the _config.yml file in your repository. You can also add a description for your site.

Click the Code tab of your repository.

In the file list, click _config.yml to open the file.

Click  to edit the file.

The _config.yml file already contains a line that specifies the theme for your site. Add a new line with title: followed by the title you want. Add a new line with description: followed by the description you want. For example:

theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
title: Octocat's homepage
description: Bookmark this to keep an eye on my project updates!
When you are done editing the file, click Commit changes.
